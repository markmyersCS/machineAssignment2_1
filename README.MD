# Problem 1

All machineAssg2-1 code is located in the `machineAssg2-1` directory. 

## Requirements

C++ compiler/interpreter. Code was developed with c++11. 


## Execution

The program can be executed with a command in the form:
```
./machineAssg2_1 'decimal' 'integer'
```
Where decimal is any decimal number within double precision and integer is any integer to be used as the base. 


## Sample Output

if run with the command: 

```
./machineAssg2_1 .22 6
```
The output will be:
```
Originial:	0.22
Base 6 result:	0.1;1;5;3;0;4;1;5;
```

if run with the command: 

```
./machineAssg2_1 .65 9
```

The output will be:
```
Originial:	0.65
Base 9 result:	0.5;7;5;7;5;7;5;7;
```
